# GoBang

### Introduction

*  A toy Gobang project with a simple AI which is implemented using [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algrithm.

*  To run this program, you just need [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine and use the command below to start:
        python demo.py

### TODO

  Use [Cython](http://cython.org/) to accelerate the speed of MCTS to get better AI performance.
